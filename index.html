<!-- Current website ananysis:

The site, overall, is closed to being complete. At least, from a week-1 perspective.
I tried to make it as close to the image examples as I could, but there are a few bugs
that have yet to be worked out. While this is going to be largely handled in the 
coming weeks, I'd like to see the site more responsive, from the onset, even prior
to using things like Bootstrap for different size viewports. Currently, the smaller 
the screen, the worse it looks. The name largely disappears, the top nav acts weird,
and the sticky-footer isn't quite sticking to the bottom as I would like to see, as 
the screen gets smaller. Looking forward to bootstrap! -->

              <h3>Future Web Dev Ninja:</h3>
              <p>You are looking at the future of web development. My name is 
              Jeffrey Phelps, student at the University of Denver's Web 
              Development Bootcamp 2017/2018. I am currently learning all the 
              latest in modern web design and development and hope to soon be 
              one of the leading web developers in the <em>real</em> world.
              <br><br>
              I am pictured here monitoring the matrix from the 
              homeofficekenezer, captured as I was preparing to have human-kind's 
              entire coding library uploaded to my brain. We were unfortunately 
              destracted by a group of sentinels and our electro-magnetic pulse, 
              intended to destroy them, also wreaked havoc on our systems, for 
              some reason. In addition to a giant, new debugging issue, this has 
              currently forced me to learn coding the "old fashioned way," as 
              they say, here at the University.
              <br><br>
              All is not lost, however, as DU is a fine institution in the matrix 
              and should do more than suffice in guiding me toward my goal of 
              becoming a well-rounded, full-stack web developer. The rest will 
              be up to me, but the sky's the limit.
              <br><br>
              This information, including examples given of what I've learned to 
              do, will be updated periodically and shown in the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> 
              section of this site. Remember...All I'm offering is the truth.</p>
