The advent of @media queries changed everything! It went from a static mess, 
to a more controlled mess. LOL But, much nicer, in general, now that it flows 
a little better as the screen size changes. I can see that setting up the 
framework a little defferently from the onset, going into the build with 
responsiveness in mind, will make it a lot easier to add responsiveness to
the site after it's built for the largest initial screen size. Seems like 
using percentages, instead of fixed widths, for the content divs/boxes and 
margins, may may make it easier in some cases to add responsiveness to the 
site, in general. It looks pretty close, though, at this point.

Chrome's "Window Resizer" extention made it much quicker to go back and 
forth between viewport sizes, saving a ton of time!

I also deviated some from the suggested break points of 980px, 768px, and 
640px. I instead found the points at which my site started to do funny things 
and adjusted it accordingly at those points. This added a few steps to the 
overall project, but not too bad and good practice, as well. 

I'll also likely change the front image and bio info to something a little 
more appropriate, as my skills improve and we get closer to graduation. This 
includes changing it on all my other social media platforms, as well. I 
currently use the same one on all of them, as a placeholder. -->

              <h3>Future Web Dev Ninja:</h3>
              <p>You are looking at the future of web development. My name is 
              Jeffrey Phelps, student at the University of Denver's Web 
              Development Bootcamp 2017/2018. I am currently learning all the 
              latest in modern web design and development and hope to soon be 
              one of the leading web developers in the <em>real</em> world.
              <br><br>
              I am pictured here monitoring the matrix from the 
              homeofficekenezer, captured as I was preparing to have human-kind's 
              entire coding library uploaded to my brain. We were unfortunately 
              destracted by a group of sentinels and our electro-magnetic pulse, 
              intended to destroy them, also wreaked havoc on our systems, for 
              some reason. In addition to a giant, new debugging issue, this has 
              currently forced me to learn coding the "old fashioned way," as 
              they say, here at the University.
              <br><br>
              All is not lost, however, as DU is a fine institution in the matrix 
              and should do more than suffice in guiding me toward my goal of 
              becoming a well-rounded, full-stack web developer. The rest will 
              be up to me, but the sky's the limit.
              <br><br>
              This information, including examples given of what I've learned to 
              do, will be updated periodically and shown in the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> 
              section of this site. Remember...All I'm offering is the truth.</p>
